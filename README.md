## Introduction

You will code a multi-processing and multi-threading program that finds the prime numbers.
The number interval for search (interval_min and interval_max), the number of processes
(np) and the number of threads (nt) will be given as command line arguments. The number
interval will be used as a search space to find prime numbers. You need to divide the number
interval among np process, and each process should also divide them among nt threads. Threads
will be responsible for finding the prime numbers in the assigned range. Upon completion of
threads, processes should relay the found prime numbers to the main process through a shared
memory. Finally, the main process prints the prime numbers that are calculated in ascending
order. You will only submit a single source code file through Ninova.

## Program Input

Program inputs are the number interval (interval_min, interval_max), the number of
processes(np) and the number of threads(nt). These inputs should be received as a command
line argument. To evaluate your programs, multiple options will be used.

```
./yourprogram interval_min interval_max np nt
```
```
Example command: ./yourprogram 101 200 2 2
```
```
It will create 2 processes and each process will create 2 threads.
Process 1 will be responsible for the numbers between 101 - 150
Thread 1- 1 will check for primality in the range of 101 - 125
Thread 1- 2 will check for primality in the range of 125 - 150
Process 2 will be responsible for the numbers between 151 - 200
Thread 2- 1 will check for primality in the range of 151 - 175
Thread 2- 2 will check for primality in the range of 176 - 200
```
## Main Process

```
Interval_min=
Interval_max=
np=
nt=
```
## Process 1

```
Distribute the
interval among
threads and send
the prime numbers
to the main process
over the shared
memory.
```
## Thread 1- 1

```
Search prime
numbers in 101 - 125
```
```
101, 103, 107, 109, 113
```
## Thread 1- 2

```
Search prime
numbers in 126 - 200
```
##### 127, 131, 137, 139, 149

## Process 2

```
Distribute the
interval among
threads and send
the prime numbers
to the main process
over the shared
memory.
```
## Thread 2- 1

```
Search prime
numbers in 151 - 175
```
##### 151, 157, 163, 167, 173

## Thread 2- 2

```
Search prime
numbers in 176 - 200
```
##### 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199


### Processes and Threads

Your program should have the following functionality for the processes and threads.

- Master Process: Master process should receive arguments as a command line
    argument. Then, it should create np slave processes. It will also divide the number
    interval into the number of processes, and distribute them among the slave processes.
    (E.g. If the initial range is 1-10 and the number of slave processes is 2, the processes
    will be assigned to the ranges of 1-5 and 6-10) Upon completion of slave processes, the
    main process must print the prime numbers that are sent over the shared memory by
    the processes in ascending order.
- Slave(Child) Processes: Each slave process should create nt worker threads and assign
    a number range to each thread. Upon completion of its threads, the slave process must
    send the prime numbers that are calculated by the worker threads to the main process
    over a shared memory.
- Worker Threads: Each worker thread is responsible for checking primality of numbers

### in the defined range. You can use a simple divisibility test for the checking primality.

- Each processes and threads should print a starting and an ending message as seen
    in the sample output.
- The slave processes and the worker threads must be able to work in parallel.

### Include development environment information, compilation and running

### commands as a comment in your code.

## EXAMPLE:

#### // Development environment: Lubuntu 16.04

#### // To compile: gcc -c main.c â€“pthread

#### // To run: ./a.out interval_min interval_max np nt

#### // Example: ./a.out 101 200 2 2

screen. Please note that, the order of lines may be different at each run.
